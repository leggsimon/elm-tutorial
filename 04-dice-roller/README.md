# Dice Roller

Generating random numbers in Elm from the [Elm-Lang guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/effects/random.html)

In this directory install using
```
elm package install
```

Run
```
elm-reactor
```

### TODO:

Exercises: Here are some that build on stuff that has already been introduced:

- Instead of showing a number, show the die face as an image.
- Add a second die and have them both roll at the same time.

And here are some that require new skills:

- Instead of showing an image of a die face, use the [`elm-lang/svg`](https://github.com/elm-lang/svg) library to draw it yourself.
- After you have learned about tasks and animation, have the die flip around randomly before they settle on a final value.
